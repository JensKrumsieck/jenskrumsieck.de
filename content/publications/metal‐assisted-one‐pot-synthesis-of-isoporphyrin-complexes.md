Zinc and cadmium complexes of _meso_‐arylisoporphyrins carrying a
pyrrolyl or dipyrrinyl substituent at the sp<sup>3</sup> carbon atom were
obtained through a simple one‐pot variation of the Alder–Longo porphyrin
synthesis. Key to the formation and stabilization of isoporphyrins is the
presence of metal acetates during the oxidative macrocyclization step. The
characteristic Q‐bands of isoporphyrins are found in the NIR region between
750 nm and 880 nm. All of the isolated pyrrolyl‐ and dipyrrinyl‐appended
isoporphyrins are stable under typical laboratory conditions and allow
chemical transformations like BF<sub>2</sub> coordination, transmetalation,
and ligand exchange.
