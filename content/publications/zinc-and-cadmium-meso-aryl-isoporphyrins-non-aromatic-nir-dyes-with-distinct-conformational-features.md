A series of pyrrolyl and dipyrrinyl isoporphyrins carrying
different phenyl and thienyl groups is reported. The compounds are
obtained by a one-pot approach in the presence of a template
reagent. Thienyl derivatives gave better yields, and were the only
subclass to form with sterical hindrance. The structural analyses
carried out on compounds **1** and **14** revealed distinct conformational
differences which are likely to result from an intramolecular NH<sup>…</sup>Cl
hydrogen bridge of the pyrrolyl subclass. In addition, this hydrogen
bridge strongly favours one of the two possible atropisomers.
Hindered rotation of the *meso*-aryl groups is observed only in the
cases of methylbenzothienyl derivatives **10** and **15** and leads to the
observation of several diastereomers. NIR absorptions up to 923 nm
are found throughout. Electrochemical investigations into the 1e<sup>-</sup> and
2e<sup>-</sup> reduced species unravel axial ligand exchange dynamics for the
zinc isoporphyrin radical, and the probable formation of a zinc
phlorinate.
