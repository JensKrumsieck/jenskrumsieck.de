                Thus being aromatic molecules porphyrinoids are not flat. They turn out to be true athletes, performing a variety of gymnastic exercises. Their three-dimensional structure heavily influences their properties and is driven by the combination of the molecule's vibrational modes. The out-of-plane distortion modes got the biggest influence on the molecules properties, a quantitative analysis is therefore mandatory. PorphyStruct can do these analyses for a wide range of porphyrinoids within seconds. The Software has been published in Chemistry - A European Journal and was rated as "Very Important".
